# 👨‍💻 Roman Kuzmin — Developer / Systems Analyst

> *"If your legacy code frightens you, it's probably working. If it terrifies you — call me."*

Greetings, traveler of GitHub.

I'm Roman — a software engineer, analyst, and full-stack developer with 25+ years of experience wrestling with systems so old, they remember dial-up. My toolbox includes everything from C++, PHP and Delphi to React, Spring, PostgreSQL, and Unreal Engine 4.

I specialize in:
- 🔍 Reverse engineering chaotic codebases
- ⚙️ Building backend systems and APIs
- 🧪 Prototyping complex ideas into working products
- 🖼️ Occasionally styling UIs — enough to not offend the eyes
- 🎮 Modding games and developing logic-heavy features in UE4 and Godot

### 🧠 Philosophy
I don’t build pixel-perfect UI. I build strong system foundations so others can.
Think of me as a tech architect, archaeologist, and troubleshooter rolled into one — who also knows where your CSS broke.

I’ve built exchanges between 1C and websites, automated businesses, written backend engines in PHP+Delphi hybrid servers (yes, that’s a thing), and helped companies out of tech debt deeper than Mariana Trench.

### 📌 Key Projects & Achievements

- 🏠 **1995**: Developed a utility billing and payment tracking system for a municipal housing company named *DomStroy* (translated: *HouseBuilder Inc.*).  
  Written in **Clipper Summer ‘87**, using **DBF (NTX/CDX indexed)** databases, this system helped manage household payments in post-Soviet infrastructure where spreadsheets were still sci-fi.

- 🌐 **2019**: Participated in the development and testing of the **RAEC system** ([raec.su](https://raec.su)) — a B2B catalog and integration platform built around the **German ETIM standard** for product classification in the electrical industry.  
  Tech stack included **PHP**, **Delphi**, and **C++**.  
  Focused on API development, client communication workflows, and complex product data synchronization.

### 🧰 Technologies I’ve ~fought with~ mastered:
- PHP, Delphi, Java, Spring Boot
- React, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- PostgreSQL, MS SQL, MySQL, 1C
- Godot, UE4, Bitrix, WordPress
- Windows Server, Ubuntu Server
- Transact-SQL, adaptive layouts

### 🧭 Currently:
Helping clients build robust web apps via [prosto.website](http://prosto.website) — minimalistic by design, powerful by backend, and not too shabby on the frontend either.
